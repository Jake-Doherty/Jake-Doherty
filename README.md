A Software Developer that gets excited at the prospect of a new challenge and loves to produce clear and consistent work. Enjoys working with teammates to find clean and concise solutions to our problems, either in lead or under the direction of someone else. Always keeping an open mind to best connect and empathize with those around me. Every point of view is important, and can be learned from no matter if one is at the top or working the ground floor.

creating art, music, functional objects, and opening the mind to different viewpoints has instilled strong values of empathy, compassion, and helpfulness. We can take influence from many things, but it is up to us to bring them together and paint our own picture. Consistently pushing my boundaries into new ventures in order to gain a better world view.

I am comfortable working with:
