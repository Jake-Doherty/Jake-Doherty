A Software Developer that gets excited at the prospect of a new challenge and loves to produce clear and consistent work. Enjoys using communication, teamwork, and problem solving to find clean and concise solutions to our problems. Keeps an open mind to best connect and empathize with those around me. creating art, music, functional objects, and opening the mind to different viewpoints has instilled strong values of empathy, compassion, and helpfulness. Consistently pushes boundaries into new ventures in order to gain a better world view.

Every point of view is important, and can be learned from no matter if one is in leadership or working the ground floor. We can take influence from many things, but it is up to us to bring them together and paint our own picture.
